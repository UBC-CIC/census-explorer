# Recommendations for Further Improvement

These are features that are recommended to be included in a production-ready version of this solution.

- Making the platform available in both official languages: English and French.
- Ability to save selections / queries, so that the user can return to previous queries
- Allow the user to select combinations of variables to filter and search the information. For example: FSA, age and income; FSA, income and language; sex, age and language.
- To improve performance, have the FSAs join together as the user zooms out of the heatmap, drawing fewer shapes.
- Add a “super-user” mode, in which users can input their own queries into a command line interface.
- Include more data sets that can fulfill multiple User Stories.
- The ability for users to input their own data to compare it with the datasets of the platform.
- The ability to create charitable profiles for recommendations.
- Implement Amazon DynamoDB cache in case the application reaches hundreds of thousands of users to reduce the Amazon DynamoDB Read costs.
